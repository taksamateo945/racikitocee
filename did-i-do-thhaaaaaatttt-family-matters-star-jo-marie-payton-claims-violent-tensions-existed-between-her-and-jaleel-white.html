Standards and practices will not let that pass; it’s not gonna happen.” However, White reportedly “wanted to do it anyway… He was so mad. He started kicking and screaming and stuff.”&nbsp;</p><p>She added, “He said something about, ‘She must want to melee.’ I said, ‘What’s a melee?’ He said, ‘a fight.’ I turned around; if he wanna fight, I would,” the veteran actress continued. “Darius [McCrary] grabbed me. I was gonna whip his behind.”</p><p>However, in hindsight, Payton said she could now see that White was “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just a kid</a>” at the time and still adjusting to his new Hollywood life. She said that she doesn’t give him “all the credit” for his behavior. “I give some of those adults credit, too,” she said. “Letting him run wild and do whatever he wanted to do, thinking he can say what he wants to say, you know, and hurt people’s feelings and all that.”</p><p>Last November, White spoke briefly about some of that tension that ensued after he unexpectedly became a more central member of the cast due to the popularity of his character. “My arrival to ‘Family Matters’ was a rocky start at the beginning,” White shared. “[The cast] kind of had to accept that I was there. That was a process.”</p><p>Payton agreed at the time, stating that there was some resentment following news that the show’s “dynamic was going to change” after Urkel’s introduction midway through the first season.</p><p>“When he came on, [producers] told us the dynamic was going to change, the shows were going to be about him, and we said, ‘OK.,’ We weren’t happy about it,” she admitted. “I think along the way, it got to be a little resentful, but it was just an adjustment that we had to make.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49uZmltX5m2pXnIZpuoZaSdtaKtwJqYmqykqcFussCmoKWxXaKutcDEq6pmq6SWv262zmakmqqZmnqxrditpqdlk6GuqrnSZq2ip5yau7V5056lrKGfo8Busdeiqq2dlGKvpsDWnpynZZiav26tzZ1ko5mcmrKtedahoK2dXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-phypers-19720916-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Astrology Birth Chart of Aaron Phypers (Family Member) 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./word-that-begins-many-sentences-but-is-unlikely-to-end-one-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Word that begins many sentences but is unlikely to end one</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlie-bit-my-finger-youtube-stars-are-all-grown-up-watch-2015224.html>Charlie Bit My Finger YouTube Stars Are All Grown Up: Watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-shares-khloe-kardashians-baewatch-swimsuit-body-2015208.html>Kendall Jenner Shares Khloe Kardashian's &amp;quot;Baewatch&amp;quot; Swimsuit Body</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./karina-seabrook.html>EXPLORE Karen Gravanos Daughter Karina Seabrook Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram, Dat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-baldwin-explains-how-justin-bieber-helped-her-deal-with-some-intense-cyberbullying-after-getting-married-to-him-483514.html>Hailey Baldwin Explains How Justin Bieber Helped Her Deal With Some Intense Cyberbullying After Gett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10041561-ranking-every-roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar-match-before-wwe-summerslam-finale.html>Ranking Every Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar Match Before WWE SummerSlam Finale | News, Scores, Highl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomDash.
