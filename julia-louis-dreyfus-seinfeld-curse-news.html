The follow-up series projects of <strong>Jason Alexander</strong>, <strong>Michael Richards</strong>, and <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a></strong> ended up being swiftly canceled, which led to the media declaring that there was a "Seinfeld curse." Essentially, they meant that with the sitcom now in reruns, the cast's careers were over, too.</p><p>Now, 25 years in the future, it seems that the press spoke a little too soon. And nowhere is that more evident than in the career of Louis-Dreyfus. The actor starred in two more celebrated TV comedy series—The New Adventures of Old Christine and Veep—and is now tied with <strong>Cloris Leachman</strong> for the most Primetime Emmy wins for any actor ever.</p><p>The 62-year-old TV icon looked back at the reports of a "Seinfeld curse" in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, calling the idea of it "moronic." Read on to see what she and her Seinfeld co-stars have had to say about what was made of their post-show careers.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>6 Classic Sitcom Episodes That Are Wildly Offensive by Today's Standards</a>.</strong></p><p>When Rolling Stone asked <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Louis-Dreyfus about the so-called curse</a>, she agreed that it was created by the press.</p><p>"It&nbsp;was&nbsp;invented by the media," she said. "They thought it was clever. You don't need me to prove it wrong, it was ridiculous! It made no sense. I was amazed that it had legs, because it was so moronic. I don't know how else to say it! [Laughs]"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/julia-emmy.jpg><p>Though her first attempt at leading a sitcom after Seinfeld ended,&nbsp;Watching Ellie, was canceled after 16 episodes in 2003, Louis-Dreyfus came back in a big way with The New Adventures of Old Christine. In 2006, it won her the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. This was&nbsp;her second Emmy win after taking home the award for Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Seinfeld in 1996.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>During her speech</a>, she referenced the fact that many believed the stars of Seinfeld would never find the same amount of success again. "I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!" the actor said on stage.</p><p>Louis-Dreyfus went on to win the same award six more times for playing Selina Meyer on the political comedy,&nbsp;Veep.</p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/jerry.jpg><p>After his sitcom series ended, <strong>Jerry </strong><strong>Seinfeld</strong> focused on his stand-up comedy again, touring and putting out specials. In 2012, his talk show Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&nbsp;premiered, and it ran until 2019.</p><p>In 2010, he poked fun at the rumors during an <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>episode of </a><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>.</p><p>"Let me tell you this about the Seinfeld curse. I like anything named after me," he joked. "There never was a Seinfeld&nbsp;curse, because <strong>Larry David</strong> did so well, and I've done well. The&nbsp;New Adventures of Old Christine, Julia won an Emmy."</p><p>David, who co-created Seinfeld, went on to create and star in the long-running series Curb Your Enthusiasm.</p><p>"Whaddya mean? Julia [Louis-Dreyfus] has a hit show. She's won an Emmy. It was the most absurd, silliest, stupidest thing to say that there was a curse," <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>David told Esquire of the curse in 2009</a>. "It's so annoying to hear something like that. There was no curse. It's crazy. So there were two TV shows attempted that didn't work? Big deal. How many TV shows work?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/jason.jpg><p>Alexander, who went on to act in more movies and television shows, as well as on stage, told Entertainment Weekly in 2017 that&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>he does feel cursed by the show</a>, but not in the way most who used the term mean it.</p><p>"If there is a&nbsp;Seinfeld&nbsp;curse, and I don't really believe that there is one, but the curse so to speak is that the show is still out there in such a profound way," he said. "George is such an iconic image that I think some producers with other opportunities go, 'You know what, we don't want the George comparison. We don't want the audience to even think about that.' So it kept away some shows that I may have liked to do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Michael-Richards-in-2012.jpg><p>As for Richards, the last of the four main cast members, it was a racist tirade caught on video that impacted his career more than any supposed curse. During a 2006 stand-up gig, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>he yelled at a heckler</a> and called him the n-word multiple times. Though Richards apologized and has taken on the occasional acting job over the years, he never found the same level of post-Seinfeld&nbsp;fame as his co-stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmo62cnq5uuM6uoKxllKeyurLUrGSsnZmjs6a4w2aarqqjmnqvsdasZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nyt-crossword-answers-for-january-27-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NYT Crossword Answers for January 27 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./venue-where-you-could-have-a-me-day-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Venue where you could have a me day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlie-bit-my-finger-youtube-stars-are-all-grown-up-watch-2015224.html>Charlie Bit My Finger YouTube Stars Are All Grown Up: Watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-shares-khloe-kardashians-baewatch-swimsuit-body-2015208.html>Kendall Jenner Shares Khloe Kardashian's &amp;quot;Baewatch&amp;quot; Swimsuit Body</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./karina-seabrook.html>EXPLORE Karen Gravanos Daughter Karina Seabrook Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram, Dat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-baldwin-explains-how-justin-bieber-helped-her-deal-with-some-intense-cyberbullying-after-getting-married-to-him-483514.html>Hailey Baldwin Explains How Justin Bieber Helped Her Deal With Some Intense Cyberbullying After Gett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10041561-ranking-every-roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar-match-before-wwe-summerslam-finale.html>Ranking Every Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar Match Before WWE SummerSlam Finale | News, Scores, Highl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomDash.
