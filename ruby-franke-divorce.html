The divorce petition, which is sealed under Utah law, highlights the need for a fresh start for both parties involved. Additionally, a domestic relations injunction has been issued, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a respectful and non-harassing environment for their children. This injunction serves as a reminder that despite the challenges they face, the well-being of their children remains a top priority.</p><p>It is a heartbreaking situation for the Franke family, who once captivated audiences with their parenting approach.

Their YouTube channel, “8Passengers,” catapulted them into the spotlight, where they amassed a dedicated following of millions. However, their path to success was not without controversy.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=YouTube_Channel_%E2%80%9C8Passengers%E2%80%9D></span>YouTube Channel “8Passengers”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EudKSf2e9_o5IrxAoCdi7g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTM2MA--/media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.gma.com/a1a0bb82d2d832515cf3527f85f14883 alt="Ruby Franke's husband files for divorce as she faces charges of felony child abuse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“8Passengers” became a sensation, captivating viewers with its unique portrayal of the Frankes’ parenting approach.
