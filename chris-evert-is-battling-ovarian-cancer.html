I’ve lived a very charmed life. Now I have some challenges ahead of me. But, I have comfort in knowing the chemotherapy is to ensure that cancer does not come back.”</p><p>The sporting champion – who underwent a “preventive hysterectomy” in December 2021 after her sister Jeanne died from the same type of cancer in February 2020 – went on to speak about how the diagnosis had left her “in a daze.”</p><p>She said: “I was in a daze. I just couldn’t believe it. I had been working out, doing CrossFit, playing tennis. I didn’t feel anything different. When I go into chemo, Jeanne is my inspiration, I’ll be thinking of her. And she’ll get me through it.”</p><p>Chris then went on to offer health advice to readers and fans, urging them to make sure they are aware of family history and to follow their gut instincts.</p><p>She wrote: “Be your own advocate. Know your family’s history. Have total awareness of your body, follow your gut and be aware of changes. Don’t try to be a crusader and think this will pass.”</p><p>Chris later took to Twitter to release a statement in which she reasoned her decision to share her diagnosis with the world, admitting she felt “very lucky” that the cancer was noticed in its early stages.</p><p>She said: ” I wanted to share my stage 1 ovarian cancer diagnosis and the story behind it as a way to help others,” she wrote. “I feel very lucky that they caught it early and expect positive results from my chemo plan.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnJ%2BroaNisrex0a1koqtdl661wMuipaBln6uus7XAp2ScmZ6YsrN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blac-chynas-easter-pics-with-king-cairo-and-dream-kardashian-have-fans-criticizing-her-387426.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blac Chynas Easter Pics With King Cairo And Dream Kardashian Have Fans Criticizing Her</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chitra-sukhu-van-peebles-everything-about-mario-van-peebles-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Everything About Mario Van Peebles' Wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlie-bit-my-finger-youtube-stars-are-all-grown-up-watch-2015224.html>Charlie Bit My Finger YouTube Stars Are All Grown Up: Watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-shares-khloe-kardashians-baewatch-swimsuit-body-2015208.html>Kendall Jenner Shares Khloe Kardashian's &amp;quot;Baewatch&amp;quot; Swimsuit Body</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./karina-seabrook.html>EXPLORE Karen Gravanos Daughter Karina Seabrook Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram, Dat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-baldwin-explains-how-justin-bieber-helped-her-deal-with-some-intense-cyberbullying-after-getting-married-to-him-483514.html>Hailey Baldwin Explains How Justin Bieber Helped Her Deal With Some Intense Cyberbullying After Gett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10041561-ranking-every-roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar-match-before-wwe-summerslam-finale.html>Ranking Every Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar Match Before WWE SummerSlam Finale | News, Scores, Highl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomDash.
