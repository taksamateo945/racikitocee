While he was the NBA’s sixth man of the year in 1994, Dell Curry’s greatest contribution to basketball came while he was playing for the Cavs in 1988. During his stint in Ohio, he and his wife, Sonya Curry, gave birth to one of the greatest shooters of all time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trending-today><strong>Trending Today:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=#>Taye Diggs’ Ex-Wife Idina Menzel Says Black Community’s ‘Disappointment’ That He Married a ‘White, Jewish Girl’ Influenced Divorce</a></li><li><a href=#>‘Everything She Do Is Creepy’: Fans Say Tiffany Haddish Was ‘Doing the Most’ After She Seductively Dances Near Michael Jordan</a></li><li><a href=#>‘It’ll Make You Three-Consider, Not Reconsider’: Rick Ross Says Jada Pinkett Smith Revealing Secrets About Her Marriage to Will Smith Makes Him Rethink Getting Close to a Woman</a></li></ul><p>Their happy union came to a halt in 2021 when Dell both filed for divorce. Sonya Curry was the first to file, as she stated that Dell Curry had committed “marital misconduct.” She claimed that the former Raptor had multiple extramarital affairs with different women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Collage-Maker-20-Oct-2023-01-43-PM-9152-1-600x338.jpg><p>Dell Curry followed suit and filed divorce papers of his own, claiming that Sonya Curry had “performed acts of illicit misconduct.” He also believed that she had stayed with another man during his NBA career.</p><p>Though the pair filed their papers in 2021, Sonya Curry stated that the couple had separated the year prior.</p><p>The public realized that the Curry marriage was truly over during the 2022 NBA Finals. While their son battled against the Boston Celtics for the Larry O’Brien trophy, Dell and Sonya Curry sat in separate areas. However, when Steph ultimately won his fifth ring, his parents came together to congratulate him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The former couple also went to that year’s finals with their alleged new partners. At the time, Sonya Curry was seen at the game with former NFL tight end Steven Johnson. Johnson was named in Dell Curry’s divorce filing as the man Sonya Curry had cheated on him with, according to documents obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a>.</p><p>Dell Curry was seen at the game with a woman named Nicki Smith. A rumor spread that Johnson and Smith had been married and that the Currys were doing a “spouse swap,” but this theory has been debunked, as Johnson was married to a woman named Kim.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dell Curry’s new gf and Sonia’s new man used to be married 😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PnWLc7pn8N</a></p>— mev 🏀🧸🌹 (@mevvybear) <a href=#>June 11, 2022</a><p>While there has been no update on the relationship status of Steven and Sonya, Dell and Nicki are seemingly still going strong. During an interview with <a href=#>The Charlotte Observer</a>, the 59-year-old broke the news that he and Smith have been married for “almost a year.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;ATLANTA BLACK STAR’S free daily newsletters&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the latest developments from top news headlines to celebrity news.</strong></a></p><p>When talking about his marriage, Dell said that it was great. He said that he didn’t know what he was going to do after his divorce, but then his friends introduced him to his second wife. “I’d met her a couple of times,” Dell said, “We talked on the phone for a month before I laid eyes on her.”</p><p>Dell said that it wasn’t his plan to get remarried, but now that he has, “life is great right now.” Dell said that his “home situation is sound” because his kids are happy for him, and he is happy for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BpZmtoX6jBprzHZpquqqKueqWtw2abnqScYrC2vtGyZKudnZa%2Fs7XEnWSdoaakv6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./calle-walton.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Calle Walton And What Is She Known For?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-medlin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Medlin- Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Dating, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlie-bit-my-finger-youtube-stars-are-all-grown-up-watch-2015224.html>Charlie Bit My Finger YouTube Stars Are All Grown Up: Watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-shares-khloe-kardashians-baewatch-swimsuit-body-2015208.html>Kendall Jenner Shares Khloe Kardashian's &amp;quot;Baewatch&amp;quot; Swimsuit Body</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./karina-seabrook.html>EXPLORE Karen Gravanos Daughter Karina Seabrook Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram, Dat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-baldwin-explains-how-justin-bieber-helped-her-deal-with-some-intense-cyberbullying-after-getting-married-to-him-483514.html>Hailey Baldwin Explains How Justin Bieber Helped Her Deal With Some Intense Cyberbullying After Gett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10041561-ranking-every-roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar-match-before-wwe-summerslam-finale.html>Ranking Every Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar Match Before WWE SummerSlam Finale | News, Scores, Highl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomDash.
