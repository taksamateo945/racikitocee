From their first compatibility challenge together on the show Perfect Match, it was clear that Francesca and Dom had an eye on each other. However, Francesca had moved on from Dom she chose on the show. </span>She was single during filming and did not date Jesse on the program, but they have been together for a long time.</strong></p><p>Nobody knows love and turmoil like the cast of The <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Perfect Match</strong></a>. The Perfect Match is a reality TV dating show that pairs contestants from eight different <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Netflix</strong></a> reality TV shows, including Love Is Blind, Too Hot to Handle, The Circle, and The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On. It premiered its inaugural season on Netflix on February 14, 2023.</p><p>The show, hosted by <strong>Nick Lachey</strong> (who previously presented Love Is Blind and The Ultimatum), follows ten former Netflix reality TV contestants as they relocate into a tropical villa and date each other in the hopes of finding their perfect match. Those who do not have a match are eliminated each week when new candidates arrive at the villa to try to break up couples and find theirs. Finally, the pair voted as the perfect match by the eliminated participants is proclaimed the winner and receives a financial award.</p><p>It's a show full of love, drama, conflict, strategy, and gameplay. Different people arrive with different motives as well as varied emotional baggage. There is no stated objective in this program to indicate the existence of a certain goal. That reflects where people are in their lives, and they may be seeking someone to spend the summer with or have a fling with, or they may be looking for a life mate. It is entirely up to them to determine their ideal mate.</p><p>Despite having a partner, Too Hot to Handle star <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Francesca Farago</strong></a> is returning to Netflix for yet another reality dating show with the new series Perfect Match, which invites reality stars from other Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum, The Circle, and others to try and find their perfect match. So, what happened to her business partner, <strong>Jesse Sullivan</strong>? Are Francesca and Jesse Sullivan still together?</p><p>Previously, we talked about <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Savannah Palacio's ethnicity</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Francesca Farago's Boyfriend</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Are Joey and Kariselle Still Together</strong></a>.</p><h2>As of 2023, Francesca Farago and Jesse Sullivan Are Still Together; However, Francesca Has Moved on From Dom, Whom She Chose to Appear on the Show Perfect Match!</h2><p>Indeed, <strong>Francesca</strong> <strong>Farago</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@francescafarago</a>) and <strong>Jesse Sullivan</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jessesulli</a>) are still in a relationship. Nevertheless, because Francesca has been open about her relationship with TikTok star Jesse Sullivan, several fans were naturally surprised when they saw advertising and promos featuring her as part of the Perfect Match line-up. The two have been dating for almost a year and have a slew of fans rooting for them (who wouldn't?). They're adorable, so why is Francesca on a dating program when her social media clearly shows she's not single?</p><p>From their first compatibility challenge <a href=# rel=noopener>together</a>, it was clear that Francesca and Dom from Perfect Match. They remained one of the top contenders for the Perfect Match, however, she was bothered by the lack of a physical bond. It didn't help that their first kiss happened as a result of a challenge. Farago and Dom had given each other lower ratings than others. They were declared the least compatible couple of all extant couples. This prompted a candid talk between the two, which culminated in another kiss that seemed to wash away any misgivings Francesca had.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>While fans hoped that her new man would be found on Perfect Match, she looks to have moved on from whoever she chose on the show. According to her Instagram, she is currently dating TikTok sensation, Jesse Sullivan. Francesca revealed that she and Jesse initially met while working at an event. She and her partner have been practically inseparable since then, and a recent TikTok hint hints that the couple may be planning to elope shortly.</p><p>Perfect Match appears to have been shot in early 2022 before the couple met.&nbsp;Francesca released a TikTok video explaining what happened, noting that she did the program and that it takes time for shows to air from taping to airing. She was single during filming and did not date Jesse on the program, but they have been together for a long time, and she is pleased with the growth and relationships she formed on the show.</p><p>Francesca also likened her Perfect Match experience to Too Hot to Handle, saying that she departed with some incredible friendships that she didn't have on her first Netflix dating program. Her recent Instagram Story, which shows her hanging out with Perfect Match castmates <strong>Dom Gabriel</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@dontcalldom</a>) and <strong>Kariselle Snow</strong>, lends validity to this.</p><p>In any case, Jesse appears to be completely confident in their relationship and supportive of Francesca's participation in the dating program. He recently called her his ideal mate in a cheeky Instagram post. Jesse and Francesca are still together, in short.</p><p>Before leaving, find out <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>if Nick and Savannah are back together</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Did Dom and Savannah End up Together</strong></a>?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGidq5memLK0r8BmmKecXZ%2BytL%2FEZqqupJyew6K6jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./egypts-boy-king-of-the-14th-century-bc-for-short-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Egypt's Boy King of the 14th century BC for short</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-are-the-laginas-worth-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How much are the Laginas worth?
