Ultimately, she was killed alongside one of her sons in 1935 when the FBI raided their hideout. According to the FBI, when they found her body, she was still clutching a Tommy gun in her hands. And as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said upon her death, Barker was "the most vicious, dangerous and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade."</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Phoolan Devi</h2><span class=caption-body>Born into an incredibly poor family, Phoolan Devi was kidnapped by a gang of bandits at a young age. She eventually became romantically involved with the gang's leader and secured her place in the hierarchy, but when a fight broke out and he was murdered, the rival faction gang-raped her and left her for dead. Enraged, Devi enlisted the remaining men that she could trust, lined up 22 of her attackers and compatriots and had them shot dead. Then known as the "Bandit Queen" in India, Devi drew press attention and would even become a member of parliament before she was murdered outside her home in 2001 by associates of the men she'd had killed all those years ago.</span><span class=credit>RAVEENDRAN/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Blanche Barrow</h2><span class=caption-body>Although she lost sight in her left eye after a deadly shootout that left multiple officers dead and the Barrow gang decimated, Blanche Barrow, unlike her compatriots Bonnie and Clyde, made it out of her twenties alive.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Helen Godman</h2><span class=caption-body>Once married to the 1910s pop sensation Tell Taylor, Helen "Buda" Godman was most notoriously busted in 1916 for her part as the seductress in a badger game, which is when a wealthy businessman, caught in a compromising situation, is extorted.

Newspapers at the time described her as a "public enemy," and J. Edgar Hoover told his FBI agents to "find the woman and give her no quarter." She was eventually caught but, unlike so many of her kind, lived into old age.</span><span class=credit>Pinterest</span><h2 class=title>Mae Capone</h2><span class=caption-body>Married to Al Capone, Mae Capone may not have been a true gangster -- she once told their son "Don’t do as your father did, he broke my heart" -- but she did help cover up her husband's many crimes.<p>Pictured: Mae Capone boards the boat to visit her husband inside the prison on Alcatraz Island in 1938.</p></span><span class=credit>OFF/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Edna Murray</h2><span class=caption-body>The American public best knew Murray as the "Kissing Bandit," a nickname she earned from kissing her male robbery victims.

Ping's crime was smuggling illegal Chinese immigrants into New York, ultimately charging about 3,000 people as much as $40,000 a head -- and enlisting gangster enforcers to ensure payment. She was caught when a ship ran aground on New York City's Rockaway Beach containing 286 of them. The judge sentenced Cheng to 35 years in prison, where she died in 2014.</span><span class=credit>Pinterest</span><h2 class=title>Mary Kinder</h2><span class=caption-body>Alongside Pearl Elliott, Mary Kinder was one of the two women that the Chicago Police Department listed on their Public Enemies list in 1933.

They had no idea that six lawmen with rifles and shotguns had been camped out in the bushes alongside the road since the night before.</p><p>As the car approached, the officers rose up and fired a combined 100-plus rounds, hitting the pair several dozen times, and bringing their headline-grabbing multi-year crime spree to a dramatic end.</p><p>As their bodies lay dead and the coroner arrived on the scene, he noticed bystanders who had begun collecting souvenirs from the bodies including shell casings and clothing. One man, he noted, even reached over with a pocket knife and tried to remove Barrow's left ear.</p><p>Such is the bizarre type of fame that Parker and Barrow achieved -- and the strange hold that the gangster has had in the American imagination in the decades since.</p><p>But as much as we immortalize men like Al Capone and John Dillinger, and as much as we flock to films like The Godfather and Scarface, seldom do we think of the female gangsters that have stood at the center of violent, prosperous crime rings as well.</p><p>Although many still know the name Bonnie Parker -- herself immortalized in the film Bonnie and Clyde -- dozens of equally ruthless and successful female gangsters have since left their mark on the underworld.</p><p>From the "Mack Truck" to the "Kissing Bandit," meet some of these women in the gallery above.</p><p>Fascinated by these female gangsters?
