Thanks to Warren Jarvis, Brad got his first guitar which aided the then-upcoming music star to launch his career.</p><p>Jasper is not the only child of Kim and Brad; the youngster has a big brother who goes by the name of Williams Huckleberry Paisley. Huck, as he is fondly called, is a couple of years older than Jasper and is a high school student. The two Paisley children spend their formative years in a log house in Franklin, Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>Absolutely nothing has been said about Jasper Warren Paisley’s academic pursuits.

The couple has lived together as man and wife for almost two decades which is quite commendable and worthy of emulation.

The youngster enjoys his childhood, but that does not rule out that he may harbor some creative genes in either direction.</p><p>With that said, we must acknowledge that Kim and Brad are quite overly protective of their children, making it impossible for the media or the general public to get wind of what is currently happening in their lives.</p><h2><strong>Brad Paisley’s Son, Jasper Warren Paisley, is Passionate About Animals</strong></h2><p>According to reports, Brad Paisley’s second son, Jasper Warren Paisley, is an animal lover.
