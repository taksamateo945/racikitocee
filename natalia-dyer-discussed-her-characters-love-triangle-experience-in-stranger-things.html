The actress discussed her character Nancy Wheeler’s love triangle in the episode.&nbsp;Later, when presenter Jimmy Fallon flashed a photo of Dyer from the film’s 2009 red carpet premiere, she mentioned her Hollywood debut with Hannah Montana: The Movie. Dyer went on to say that her performance on Stranger Things was not her first major acting job.</p><p>After seeing the photograph, the actress stated:</p><p>“That was my first red carpet appearance.” And, naturally, I clothed myself. Thank you for visiting the Green Hills Mall, Betsey Johnson.”</p><p></p><h2>Natalia Dyer spoke about her part in Hannah Montana: The Movie.</h2><p>Natalia Dyer (27) reminisced with Jimmy Fallon and Megan Thee Stallion about how she won the part in Hannah Montana 2. She remembered:</p><p>“I was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee.” So, it’s not — it wasn’t a big film town back then. And then this — you know, this kind of big show came through. It was significant. Everyone was ecstatic. And, yes, they had two British, kind of twin parts that they opted to cast locally. And I —They said, ‘We want a lady from Nashville, Tennessee who is British.'”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Natalia-Dyer-2.jpg alt="Natalia Dyer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Natalia Dyer, 14, portrays Clarissa Granger, one of the two children of journalist Oswald Granger in the film (played by Peter Gunn). The film’s main enemy was a journalist who tried to discover who Hannah Montana’s hidden identity was: Miley Stewart (portrayed by Miley Cyrus).</p><p>Natalie Dyer’s character and her twin sister were huge admirers of the imaginary singer in Hannah Montana: The Movie. In 2020, the actress discussed the role more with PEOPLE Magazine. She stated:</p><p>“I’m not sure how much of it directly affected my popularity. I don’t think I really really spoke about a lot of the things I was doing at school. It was simply something that occurred.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the 27-year-old Nashville native told Cosmopolitan earlier this month that she felt she did not do a good job with her British accent in the film. She stated:</p><p>“It was a little chaotic, but it was a lot of fun.” I portrayed a British character. I don’t believe I did the accent properly, but I’m not sure I can do a good British accent anymore. It was all new to me at the time; I was young and my mother was on set.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Natalia-Dyer-3.jpg alt="Natalia Dyer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>However, the Hannah Montana movie gave Natalia Dyer the experience she needed to act in another Disney picture, The Greening of Whitney Brown, in 2011. Dyer was cast in indie films such as 2013’s Don’t Let Me Go and 2014’s After Darkness after making short cameos in similar flicks. Following that, she landed her most well-known role to date as Nancy Wheeler in Stranger Things.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilmqyRobaiecOynKtllJ7ApMHSrJydZZiav26vx5qpmpukmr%2B0ecuorZ5lpKe2orrGpZxmnailsrO1xKeanmWZo3q0wNGapaCdomLBqbXNoKpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shemp-howard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shemp Howard Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./children-shot-9-year-old-boy-killed-6-year-old-child-grazed-in-skokie-apartment-shooting-police-say.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Children Shot: 9-year-old boy killed, 6-year-old child grazed in Skokie apartment shooting, police s</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlie-bit-my-finger-youtube-stars-are-all-grown-up-watch-2015224.html>Charlie Bit My Finger YouTube Stars Are All Grown Up: Watch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kendall-jenner-shares-khloe-kardashians-baewatch-swimsuit-body-2015208.html>Kendall Jenner Shares Khloe Kardashian's &amp;quot;Baewatch&amp;quot; Swimsuit Body</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./karina-seabrook.html>EXPLORE Karen Gravanos Daughter Karina Seabrook Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram, Dat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hailey-baldwin-explains-how-justin-bieber-helped-her-deal-with-some-intense-cyberbullying-after-getting-married-to-him-483514.html>Hailey Baldwin Explains How Justin Bieber Helped Her Deal With Some Intense Cyberbullying After Gett</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10041561-ranking-every-roman-reigns-vs-brock-lesnar-match-before-wwe-summerslam-finale.html>Ranking Every Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar Match Before WWE SummerSlam Finale | News, Scores, Highl</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZoomDash.
